# Glossary List 

The Glossary List add-on for Concrete CMS allows you to display pages in an alphabetically grouped list, sorted by their titles. At the top of the list, an Aâ€“Z navigation bar appears, showing only the letters corresponding to existing entries. When a user clicks on a letter, the page automatically scrolls to the relevant section. This makes it perfect for glossaries, directories, team listings, product indexes, or any content that benefits from alphabetical organization. The add-on is fully responsive and offers a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
